### EverAssist - a small webbased voice control

This repo contains the base for EverAssist, everybody can expand it as he or she needs it. I don't have any API or similar as I don't need it for my usage. But if somebody wants to expand EverAssist, feel free.
I currently use it for controling XBMC, receiving updates for my timetable and other things. It's coded as an extension for Apples Siri, not as an replacement.
The current version is German only but a translation wouldn't be too difficult.


EverAssist is released under GNU GPL v3 license. If you'd like to see it in action, see [this page on OpenShift](http://everassist-updatechecker.rhcloud.com/?user=demo&pass=demo).
